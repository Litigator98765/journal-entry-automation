# Journal Entry Automation
The goal of this project was to automate a task I was given every week at my summer internship. This task involved taking values from an excel spreadsheet and inputting them one by one into an excel macro that would then generate an XML .txt document. This macro was useful but it took about 60 seconds per entry, and this process was prone to humna error, which means even more time spent fixing errors. This process could be optimized to save a lot of time every week. So I created a C# program whcih allowed me to copy and paste all journal entries that needed to be created into a .txt file, and the program automatically creates the correctly formatted XML output in another .txt file.
