# Journal Entry Automation
The goal of this project was to automate a task I was given every week at my summer internship. This task involved taking values from an excel spreadsheet and inputting them one by one into an excel macro that would then generate an XML .txt document. This macro was useful but it took about 60 seconds per entry, and this process was prone to human error. Each week I was given about 300 journal entries to submit, which took about 5-6 hours to complete. This process could be optimized to save a lot of time every week. So I created a C# program whcih allowed me to copy and paste all journal entries that needed to be created into a .txt file, and the program automatically creates the correctly formatted XML output in another .txt file. This program took a 5-6 hour task and reduced it to 5 minutes! This was also my first time writing code in C#, it was a fun and rewarding experience to learn some C#.

## Code
This program was just run through visual studio using the command line because I was the only one using it. The code for the progrma can be found [here](Journal Entry Automation/Program.cs)

## Example input and output
The examples [input](SampleIO/Input) and [output](SampleIO/Output) must be formatted as seen in these files. DISCLAMER: These are not the acutal values, just the format.
